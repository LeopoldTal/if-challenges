#[News ticker challenge](http://plover.net/~davidw/challenges/#chyron)

This challenge is partly inspired by Earl Grey by Rob Dubbin and Allison Parrish which reserved some space at the bottom of the screen for displaying what the player-character was thinking, moving the > prompt up a bit. I want you to do something even more ambitious, and use that below-the-prompt space for a chyron of text moving slowly leftwards in real time. The text can be silly news headlines, song lyrics, or whatever you want. Have fun with it.
