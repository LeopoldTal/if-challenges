# [Colour sequence lock challenge](http://plover.net/~davidw/challenges/#color_sequence_lock)

Code up a locked safe or strongbox with a single dial on it. Put a diamond or something inside as a prize for opening the safe.

The dial is a "rainbow dial". It can be set to any color of the rainbow: red, yellow, orange, green, blue, indigo, or violet. To unlock the safe, the PC must turn the dial to these four colors in sequence: green-yellow-orange-red.
