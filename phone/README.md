# [Ringing phone challenge](http://plover.net/~davidw/challenges/#telephone_ringing)

Find an audio clip (or record it yourself) of a ringing phone, and have it play repeatedly (with suitable breaks) in real time until the player-character answers the phone.

This also solves the [sound support test challenge](http://plover.net/~davidw/challenges/#sound_support).
