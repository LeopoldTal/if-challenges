# [Rotating house challenge](http://plover.net/~davidw/challenges/#rotating_house)

Code up the white house from Infocom's Zork I and the four plots of land around it. In the attic, add a turnable wheel mounted in the floor. Whenever the player-character turns the wheel, the entire house rotates 90Â°, changing all directional travel inside the house and where the front and back doors connect to.
