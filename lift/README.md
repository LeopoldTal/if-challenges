# [Lift challenge](http://plover.net/~davidw/challenges/#post_office_elevator)

In this challenge, reproduce the elevator in [Hero Inc Part One](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=fu9e102btvigqwpc) by Nate Cull. Code up the lift car and the four locations that it can connect to. You'll also need to code up a keypad and a display inside the lift car, and a plaque in the lobby. But otherwise, let's keep this simple: don't worry about doors or call buttons; assume the elevator is always open at whichever floor it's on.
